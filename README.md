 ### **Nick Moore** - 1st Year MURP (TPP AOC)
 
 Hi everyone! My name is Nick, I'm a first year MURP student participating in the new UCLA-Sciences Po program. My area of concentration is transportation, but have a lot of interest in realted fields of housing and sustainability. 
 
 I'm from the east side of San Jose, CA originally, where I became interested in (and frustrated by) the transit system I used to get to school and work in a relatively suburban environment. That being said, I see a lot of potential in that community and others to transition to a less car-centric design and culture.
 
 A lot of my experience in the planning space is actually more on the political side, having worked in the State Capitol and on transit/housing campaigns. Most recently, I spent the last 3 years working as a performance auditor and fraud investigator for the City of San Francisco. 
 
 I just moved to LA about a month ago, but have really enjoyed the proximity to the beach where I go for runs pretty frequently and join a weekly volleyball meetup. I also enjoy hiking, eating street food, practicing french, and doing the NYT crossword. Oh I also have a cat, Charlie:
