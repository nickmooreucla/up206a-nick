 ### **Nick Moore** - 1st Year MURP (TPP AOC)
 
 Hi everyone! My name is Nick, I'm a first year MURP student participating in the new UCLA-Sciences Po program. My area of concentration is transportation, but have a lot of interest in realted fields of housing and sustainability. 
 
 I'm from the east side of San Jose, CA originally, where I became interested in (and frustrated by) the transit system I used to get to school and work in a relatively suburban environment. That being said, I see a lot of potential in that community and others to transition to a less car-centric design and culture.
 
 A lot of my experience in the planning space is actually more on the political side, having worked in the State Capitol and on transit/housing campaigns. Most recently, I spent the last 3 years working as a performance auditor and fraud investigator for the City of San Francisco. 
 
 I just moved to LA about a month ago, but have really enjoyed the proximity to the beach where I go for runs pretty frequently and join a weekly volleyball meetup. I also enjoy hiking, eating street food, practicing french, and doing the NYT crossword. Oh I also have a cat, Charlie, who loves to prevent me from doing work:

 ### UP 206A: Introduction to GIS
 
 Based on the syllabus and our first class, I believe this course seeks to provide students with an understanding of the purpose and methods for geospatial presentation of data using open-source applications. 
 
 My personal objectives for the class include: 
 
1. Learn what kind of data is best suited for spatial visualization and identifying relationships between different types of data. 
2. Learn how to put together mutliple layers of data into an open source mapping product. 
3. Learn how to best present and message the information once original mapping is completed. 


### Preliminary Project Ideas or Areas of Interest

* Bus Shelter Map, in relation to neighborhood heat levels or environmental equity scores.
* Pothole Map based on 311 data (the roads in the Oakland/Berkeley area where I used to live are terrible, but I've wondered if poor roads are evenly distributed).
* Park/Public space access - showing what parts of a city can walk to a park or access through high quality transit.
* Mapping out funds spent on specific transit/development measures.
* Property value increases in relation to transit improvement/expansion.
